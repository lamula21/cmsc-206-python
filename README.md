# CMSC 206 Data Visualization in Python Course
A python course introducing data visualization using pandas, matplotlib, regex, and among others.

# Course Overview
Data visualization is a crucial skill for anyone working with data, as it allows you to communicate insights effectively, making data more accessible and understandable. In this course, you will learn the following key aspects of data visualization:

- Matplotlib: You will delve deep into Matplotlib, a powerful and flexible Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. You'll discover how to create various types of plots, customize their appearance, and convey your data's story effectively.

- Pandas: You will explore how to use Pandas, a versatile data manipulation library, in conjunction with Matplotlib to prepare, clean, and transform data for visualization. Learn how to handle data frames, filter data, and perform essential data operations.

- Regular Expressions (Regex): You'll understand the role of regex in data preparation and manipulation. Discover how to use regex to extract, clean, and process textual data, which is often a crucial step in data visualization.

- Other Data Visualization Libraries: While Matplotlib is a central focus, you will also be introduced to other Python libraries like Seaborn and Plotly, which offer high-level APIs for creating aesthetically pleasing and interactive visualizations.
